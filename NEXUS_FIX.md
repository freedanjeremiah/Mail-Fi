# Avail Nexus Integration - Fixed

## Issue
`buf.writeUint32BE is not a function` - Buffer polyfill was missing in browser environment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Installed Required Packages
```bash
npm install buffer process --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Created Polyfills File
**File**: `src/app/polyfills.ts`
- Imports Buffer and process for browser
- Sets them as global variables (window.Buffer, window.process, window.global)

### 3. Updated Providers
**File**: `src/app/providers.tsx`
- Added `import './polyfills'` at the top to load polyfills before Nexus SDK

### 4. Updated Next.js Config
**File**: `next.config.ts`
- Added webpack fallback configuration for Node.js modules
- Maps `buffer` → `buffer/`
- Maps `process` → `process/browser`
- Disabled server-only modules (crypto, stream, path, fs)

### 5. Disabled Turbopack (Temporary)
**File**: `package.json`
- Changed `dev` script from `next dev --turbopack` to `next dev`
- Turbopack doesn't fully support webpack polyfill config yet
- Added `dev:turbo` script for future when turbopack supports this

## Testing

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/nexus-panel
   ```

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - ✅ No "buf.writeUint32BE" error
   - ✅ "Connect Wallet" button appears
   - ✅ Can connect MetaMask/WalletConnect
   - ✅ "Initializing Nexus SDK..." appears after wallet connection
   - ✅ "Nexus SDK Ready ✓" shows when initialized
   - ✅ Transfer and Bridge buttons work

## Files Modified
1. `src/app/polyfills.ts` (NEW)
2. `src/app/providers.tsx`
3. `next.config.ts`
4. `package.json`

## Why This Works
- Nexus SDK uses Node.js crypto libraries internally
- Browser doesn't have these by default
- Buffer polyfill provides the missing `writeUint32BE` and other methods
- webpack config tells Next.js to use browser-compatible versions
