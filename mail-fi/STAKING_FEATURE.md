# PYUSD Staking Feature - Implementation Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### **1. Smart Contract** ([programs/pyusd-manifesto-contracts/src/staking.rs](programs/pyusd-manifesto-contracts/src/staking.rs))

Complete Solana smart contract with:
- **Tiered Staking System**: Bronze (8%), Silver (15%), Gold (25%), Diamond (40%)
- **Lock Period Multipliers**: Flexible (1.0x), 30-day (1.3x), 90-day (1.7x), 180-day (2.5x)
- **Continuous Rewards**: Calculated per-second based on APY
- **Auto-Compound**: Restake rewards with one click
- **Flexible Unstaking**: Withdraw after lock period ends

**Contract Functions:**
- `initialize_staking_pool` - Admin creates staking pool
- `stake` - User stakes PYUSD with chosen lock period
- `claim_rewards` - Claim accumulated rewards
- `unstake` - Withdraw staked PYUSD (after lock)
- `compound_rewards` - Auto-restake rewards

### **2. Frontend UI** ([app/staking/page.tsx](app/staking/page.tsx))

Beautiful, feature-rich staking interface with:

#### **Dashboard Stats:**
- Total Value Locked (TVL)
- Total Stakers
- Average APY

#### **User Staking Overview:**
- Current staked amount & tier
- Real-time APY calculation
- Pending rewards (live updates)
- Total claimed rewards
- Lock period countdown

#### **Staking Form:**
- Lock period selection (visual cards)
- Amount input with validation
- Real-time APY calculator
- Estimated monthly/yearly rewards
- Tier preview

#### **Action Buttons:**
- Claim Rewards
- Compound (auto-restake)
- Unstake (respects lock periods)

#### **Tier Information:**
- Visual tier cards (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond)
- APY breakdown by tier
- Minimum amounts for each tier

### **3. Client Library** ([lib/staking-manager.ts](lib/staking-manager.ts))

TypeScript manager for staking operations:
- LocalStorage-based state (temporary, ready for on-chain integration)
- Automatic reward calculation
- Tier management
- Lock period enforcement
- Pool statistics tracking

## 📊 Staking Tiers & Rewards

| Tier | Minimum Amount | Base APY | With Max Lock (2.5x) |
|------|----------------|----------|----------------------|
| 🥉 Bronze | 100 PYUSD | 8% | 20% |
| 🥈 Silver | 1,000 PYUSD | 15% | 37.5% |
| 🥇 Gold | 10,000 PYUSD | 25% | 62.5% |
| 💎 Diamond | 50,000 PYUSD | 40% | 100% |

## 🔒 Lock Period Multipliers

| Period | Multiplier | Example (Gold Tier) |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Flexible | 1.0x | 25% APY |
| 30 Days | 1.3x | 32.5% APY |
| 90 Days | 1.7x | 42.5% APY |
| 180 Days | 2.5x | 62.5% APY |

## 🎨 UI Features

### **Color-Coded Cards:**
- Purple/Indigo gradients for staking actions
- Green for claiming rewards
- Yellow/Orange for compounding
- Gray for unstaking

### **Real-Time Calculations:**
- Instant APY updates when changing amount/lock
- Live pending rewards ticker
- Automatic tier detection

### **User-Friendly:**
- Clear lock period countdown
- Minimum stake validation
- Balance display
- Tier progression visualization

## 🚀 How to Use

### **For Users:**

1. **Connect Wallet** - Click "Select Wallet" button
2. **Choose Lock Period** - Select from 4 options (or flexible)
3. **Enter Amount** - Minimum 100 PYUSD
4. **Review Estimates** - See tier, APY, and projected rewards
5. **Stake** - Confirm transaction
6. **Monitor** - Watch rewards accumulate in real-time
7. **Claim or Compound** - Withdraw rewards or increase stake
8. **Unstake** - After lock period, withdraw principal

### **Navigation:**

Access staking from any page via the top navigation:
- Send PYUSD → Escrow → Recurring → Multisig → **Staking**

## 💻 Technical Details

### **Reward Calculation Formula:**
```
Annual Rewards = Staked Amount × Effective APY
Effective APY = Base APY (tier) × Lock Multiplier

Rewards Per Second = Annual Rewards / (365 × 24 × 60 × 60)
Pending Rewards = Rewards Per Second × Seconds Elapsed
```

### **Tier Thresholds:**
```rust
TIER_BRONZE_MIN:   100 PYUSD (6 decimals = 100,000,000)
TIER_SILVER_MIN:   1,000 PYUSD
TIER_GOLD_MIN:     10,000 PYUSD
TIER_DIAMOND_MIN:  50,000 PYUSD
```

### **Lock Durations:**
```rust
LOCK_30_DAYS:  30 × 24 × 60 × 60 seconds
LOCK_90_DAYS:  90 × 24 × 60 × 60 seconds
LOCK_180_DAYS: 180 × 24 × 60 × 60 seconds
```

## 🔧 Integration Status

### ✅ **Currently Working (LocalStorage):**
- All staking operations
- Reward calculations
- Tier management
- Lock periods
- Pool statistics

### ⏳ **Ready for On-Chain (After Contract Deployment):**
- Replace `stakingManager` calls with Anchor program calls
- Use actual token transfers instead of localStorage
- Real PYUSD rewards from pool
- On-chain PDA (Program Derived Address) for each stake

## 📝 Files Created/Modified

### **New Files:**
```
programs/pyusd-manifesto-contracts/src/staking.rs
app/staking/page.tsx
lib/staking-manager.ts
```

### **Modified Files:**
