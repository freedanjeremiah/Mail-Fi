So, when you write:\n\n```\ntrait MyTrait {\n    fn get(&self) -> usize;\n}\n\nimpl<T> MyTrait for T {\n    fn get(&self) -> usize { 0 }\n}\n```\n\nThis makes the trait implemented on all types in the scope. So if you\ntry to implement it on another one after that, the implementations will\nconflict. Example:\n\n```\ntrait MyTrait {\n    fn get(&self) -> usize;\n}\n\nimpl<T> MyTrait for T {\n    fn get(&self) -> usize { 0 }\n}\n\nstruct Foo;\n\nfn main() {\n    let f = Foo;\n\n    f.get(); // the trait is implemented so we can use it\n}\n```\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/Users/I578432/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/syn-2.0.108/src/path.rs","byte_start":3445,"byte_end":3502,"line_start":116,"line_end":118,"column_start":1,"column_end":20,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"impl<T> From<T> for PathSegment","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":32},{"text":"where","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":6},{"text":"    T: Into<Ident>,","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":20}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"conflicting implementation in crate `core`:\n- impl<T> From<T> for T;","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0119]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: conflicting implementations of trait `From<PathSegment>` for type `PathSegment`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0m/Users/I578432/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/syn-2.0.108/src/path.rs:116:1\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m116\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m/\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0mimpl<T> From<T> for PathSegment\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m117\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0mwhere\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m118\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    T: Into<Ident>,\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m|___________________^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1mnote\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: conflicting implementation in crate `core`:\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m            - impl<T> From<T> for T;\u001b[0m\n\n"}
