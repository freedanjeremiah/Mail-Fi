   - Claim escrow (recipient)
   - Cancel escrow (after expiry)
   - View all user escrows

   Features:
   - Create recurring payment schedule
   - Execute payments when due
   - View all recurring payments
   - Cancel recurring payments
   - Payment history

3. MULTISIG PAGE (/multisig)
   Current: Placeholder UI
   Needed: Create lib/contracts/multisig.ts + integrate
   Features:
   - Create multisig wallet
   - Propose transactions
   - Approve/reject transactions
   - Execute when threshold met
   - View all multisig wallets

4. YIELD FARMING PAGE (/yield-farming)
   Current: Uses mock staking-manager, named "staking"
   Needed: 
   - Rename all "staking" references to "yield farming"
   - Integrate with lib/contracts/yield-farming.ts
   - Connect to real deployed contract
   Features:
   - Initialize yield farming pool
   - Deposit PYUSD for yield
   - Claim rewards
   - Compound rewards
   - Unstake with lock period checks
   - Display APY tiers (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Diamond)

CONTRACT FILES READY:
- ✅ lib/contracts/escrow.ts
- ✅ lib/contracts/recurring.ts  
- ✅ lib/contracts/yield-farming.ts (renamed from staking.ts)
- ⚠️  lib/contracts/multisig.ts (NEEDS TO BE CREATED)

All UIs should:
- Use real on-chain contract interactions
- Show loading states
- Display transaction links
- Handle errors properly
- Update balances after transactions
- Use consistent navigation with "Yield Farming" not "Staking"
