This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Browser Extension (Mailâ€‘Fi for Gmail)

This repo also contains a Chrome Manifest V3 extension that injects a payment panel into Gmail and will integrate with Avail Nexus.

### Build

```powershell
npm run build:ext
```

Artifacts will be placed in `dist/extension`.

### Load in Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Toggle on "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist/extension` folder
4. Open Gmail (https://mail.google.com). A "Pay with Avail" floating button appears. Click it to open the panel.

### Development

Watch and rebuild on changes:

```powershell
npm run watch:ext
```

### Nexus Cross-Chain Features

The extension integrates with Avail Nexus for cross-chain payments. Visit http://localhost:3000/nexus-panel to access:

- **Transfer**: Send tokens cross-chain
- **Bridge**: Bridge tokens between chains
- **Wallet Support**: MetaMask, WalletConnect, and other Web3 wallets via ConnectKit

**Key Components:**
- `src/app/providers.tsx` - Wagmi + ConnectKit + Nexus SDK setup
- `src/app/components/wallet-bridge.tsx` - Automatic SDK initialization
- `src/app/components/nexus-bridge.tsx` - Transfer and Bridge UI
- `src/app/nexus-panel/page.tsx` - Nexus panel page

**Stack:**
- Avail Nexus SDK (`@avail-project/nexus-widgets`)
- Wagmi for wallet connection
- ConnectKit for wallet UI
- React Query for state management

### API Stubs

An example route handler exists at `src/app/api/payments/route.ts` for server-side actions; wire this to Avail Nexus as needed.
